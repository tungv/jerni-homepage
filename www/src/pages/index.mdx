## Introducting jerni

After 3 years of the making, finally I can proudly introduce my most ambitous OSS project `jerni` to everyone. Today, May 17th, 2020, I finally release the v1 - one of the biggest milestone of this project.

## What is `jerni`

This is a set of JavaScript libraries and command-line tools to facilitate an opinionated event sourcing architecture, which includes (but not limit to):

1. a JavaScript library `jerni` to guide your event publishing and subscribing code.
2. a JavaScript library `jerni-dev` to simplify your integration tests
3. a command-line tool `jerni` to efficiently synchronize read-side and write-side in this event architecture.
4. a command-line tool `jerni-dev` to simplify your development workflow
5. an examplar implementation of HTTP Event Queue protocol (`heq`) backed by `redis`
