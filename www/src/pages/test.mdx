## Introducting jerni

After 3 years of the making, finally I can proudly introduce my most ambitous OSS project `jerni` to everyone. Today, May 17th, 2020, I finally release the v1 - one of the biggest milestone of this project.

## What is `jerni`?

This is a set of JavaScript libraries and command-line tools to facilitate an opinionated event sourcing architecture, which includes (but not limit to):

1. a JavaScript library `jerni` to guide your event publishing and subscribing code.
2. a JavaScript library `jerni-dev` to simplify your integration tests
3. a command-line tool `jerni` to efficiently synchronize read-side and write-side in this event architecture.
4. a command-line tool `jerni-dev` to simplify your development workflow
5. an examplar implementation of HTTP Event Queue protocol (`heq`) backed by `redis`

and moreâ€¦

## Why `jerni`?

People are constantly arguing about monolith vs micro-services. Most projects start out with a monolithic framework and a popular database system that fit their initial requirements. However, changes in requirements are inevitable especially when you're a startup. And if your startup survives, more often than not, pivotal changes need to be made, not to mention those incremental ones along the way. After a while, the tech debts that you've stacked up to catch up with deadlines become overwhelming and **"The Great Refactoring"** discussions emerge around the table. Business values enter a war with engineering desires to start over.

And in these situations, it's hard to deny that micro-services are getting some attentions.
